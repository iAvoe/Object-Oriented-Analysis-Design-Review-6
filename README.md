## Anaylsis & Design

A major comparison between analysis and design can be stated as:​
- analysis is understanding, design is solution

It is just as important to have heavy user involvement during analysis as it is during design.
- False

During analysis, analysts build models to represent the real world and to understand the desired business processes with the information used in those processes.
- True

Model building is a unique to Systems Analysis.
- False

Another name for the data model is the domain model.
- True

The output of the design activities is a set of diagrams and documents that describe the solution system.
- True

Since the design activities all interact with each other, it really doesn't matter which activity occurs first.
- False


## Software class

Package diagrams are used primarily when designing the software classes.
- Flase, class or UML diagrams

Prototypes and mock-ups are most useful in doing the design of the software classes.
- False, object-oriented design


## Describing the environment

A big part of describing the environment is identifying and defining all the types of computing devices that will be required.
- True

What are two key elements of describing the environment?
- External systems
- technology architecture

The design activity key question, "How will this system interact with other systems..." is part of which design activity?
- Describe the environment


## User Interface design

A storyboard is useful for what?​
- design of the user interface

Which of the following really is both an analysis (discovery) and a design process (solution).​
- User Interface design

Which of the following is NOT considered an analysis model?
- user interface screen layout

Designing a single user interface is now the exception, not the norm
- True

User interface design requires both analysis and design
- True

The key question to answer with the design of the user interface activity is, "How will the users interact with the system?"
- True

In user interface design the detailed screen layouts should be done after the devices have been decided.
- True

Which of the following is a type of model used in user interface design?
- System sequence diagram

When describing the interfaces to external systems, which is not one of the important issues?​
- Programming languages


## Design class diagram, design model, components

A primary model used in software design is which of the following?
- Design Class Diagram

Software methods are usually identified in which design model?
- Design Class Diagram

Which of the following is NOT considered a design model?
- Activity Diagram

Which is not a model normally produced as part of application component design?
- design class diagram

A design class diagram is also called a data model.
- False

A deployment diagram is most useful for which design activity?
- designing application components

An application component can be thought of as a(n) __________.
- unit of software

The objective of design activities is to describe in detail the components of the final solution system that will serve as a blue print for construction
- True

Defining the technology architecture is part of the activity to Design the application components
- False

One of the first steps in designing the application components is to divide the software into subsystems.
- True


## Control mechanisms & integrity

What is the name of a general control technique used to ensure that entered data is correct?​
- Data Validation Control

What is the name of the control mechanism that is used to ensure that all necessary information for a transaction has been entered?​
- completeness control

What is a control that checks the value of a field to ensure that it is within the correct range?
- Value limit control

Which is NOT an objective of integrity controls?​
- Ensure a stable functioning operating environment

An integrity control that verifies the data in one field against the data in other fields is called a ____ control.
- field combination

The primary purpose of integrity controls is to track external activity
- False

Completeness control is an integrity control that identifies when a value in a field is too large or too small.
- False

The majority of new systems today must be integrated into existing networks without disrupting existing applications.
- True

## Security and control design, user privileges

Which design activity that pervades all other design activities?​
- ​Security and controls design

Limiting user access to the system is considered what type of design activity?
- security and control design

Which of the following is not one of the design activities included in the Design System Components core process?
- Design the security controls

Which user is known to the system and is authorized to access all or certain parts of it?​
- Registered user

Three types of users that are considered in the design of a security system are ____.
- unauthorized users
- privileged users
- registered users

Which of the following can be classified as privileged users?​
- system programmers
- application programmers
- system administrators

An objective of security controls is to maintain a stable operating environment for users.
- True

A user who has special security and access to a system, such as the right to assign passwords, is called a ____.​
- privileged user

Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects the risk of fraud?
- authorization of users


## Database Design

The domain model is always used as an input to which design activity?​
- Database design

The domain model is always used as an input to which design activity?
- database design


Database design often requires someone with analysis skills since many decisions must be made about the field sizes and characteristics.
- Flase

Database design is somewhat of a stand-alone activity because each database runs under its own DBMS.
- False


## Encryption & Decryption

When the data is encrypted with the public key in asymmetric encryption, it is decrypted with a(n) ____ key.​
- private

Security design and encryption issues are addressed during database design.
- True

Symmetric key encryption uses a public key and a private key.
- False

A ____ is an institution's name and public key, which is encrypted and certified by a third party.​
- Digital certificate

Using digital signatures is primarily a technique to ____.​
- verify who sent the document


## Others

What is the first step in constructing a first-cut sequence diagram from the elements of the system sequence diagram (SSD)?
- Replace the :System object with all the objects that must collaborate

Cowboy coding is one of the newer techniques programming, often used with Agile techniques.
- False
